# WorkoutApp

The app was written using Android Studio using Pixel 2 as the testing device.

Starting the app will launch the home screen allowing users to choose do do workout or add/edit workouts.

### Do Workout  
This allows user to see their current activity list. 

Clicking on the individual activity will pop up a snackbar with some information on the activity. 

Long-pressing the activity will remove activity as indication that activity was performed during the workout session. (This does not remove the workout from the database so the same set of activity can be repeated during the next workout session)

### Edit/Add Workout
This allows useer to add new activity or edit existing ones.

Clicking existing activity will pull up existing data allowing users to overwrite.

Adding a new acitivity will permanently add the activity to the workout routine.
